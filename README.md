## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Voice Input**: The app uses the Web Speech API to capture your voice
2. **Text Processing**: Your speech is converted to text and matched against the script
3. **Smart Scrolling**: The app automatically scrolls to keep your current position centered
4. **Visual Feedback**: Words are highlighted as you speak them
5. **Smooth Experience**: Optimized for natural reading flow

## 📋 Requirements

- **Modern web browser** with Web Speech API support
- **Microphone access** for voice recognition
- **HTTPS connection** (required for microphone access in production)

## 🚀 Deployment

The `dist/` output is ready for any static hosting. Includes:

- `_headers` — Cloudflare Pages security headers + cache control
- `_redirects` — Clean URL routing (`/app` → `/app.html`)
- `manifest.json` — PWA manifest
- `sw.js` — Service worker (offline support / installable PWA)

Deploy to Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.

### Cloudflare extras (optional, free tier)

- **Script sharing** (`functions/api/share/`) needs a KV namespace bound to
  the Pages project as `SHARES` (Workers & Pages → project → Settings →
  Bindings → Add → KV namespace, variable name `SHARES`). Without the
  binding the app works normally — the Share button just reports that
  sharing isn't configured.
- **Analytics**: enable Cloudflare Web Analytics for the Pages project
  (Metrics tab), or paste your beacon token in `index.html`/`app.html`
  where marked. Cookieless — no consent banner needed.
