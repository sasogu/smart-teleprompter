# Changelog

All notable changes to Smart Teleprompter will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- 🎭 **Co-Host Mode**: Start a line with `>>` or `@Name:` to mark it as another speaker's — it renders dimmed and voice tracking skips over it to your next line regardless of its length. Toggleable in Settings (GitHub #2)
- 🎯 **Aim Marker Styles**: Choose crosshair, dot, or camera-frame marker in 5 colors (yellow, blue, red, green, white) — community request from r/elgato
- 🔴 **Hideable "Listening" Indicator**: New setting hides the red pill during recording for a clean on-camera view — community request from r/elgato
- 🏠 **Landing Page**: New feature cards for Share via Link and Offline/Installable, plus an install-as-app tip

### Changed

- ⚡ **Snappier Word Highlight**: Highlight transition reduced 0.2s → 0.1s after feedback that word marking felt sluggish
- 🔭 **Wider Lookahead Range**: Lookahead window slider max raised from 20 to 40 words so voice tracking can skip over a co-host's lines in shared scripts (GitHub #2)

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Tooltip Position**: Toolbar tooltips drifted toward mid-screen once the script had scrolled (visible in the installed PWA) — fixed-position tooltips were offset by `window.scrollY`
- 📱 **Tooltips on Touch Devices**: No longer shown — they only appeared after the tap had already fired and referenced keyboard shortcuts that don't exist on mobile
- ↔️ **Tooltip Clipping**: Tooltips near the screen edge (e.g. leftmost toolbar buttons) now shift to stay fully visible
- 📱 **Toolbar Overflow Hints**: On narrow screens, tappable arrow buttons with edge fades now show when more toolbar icons are hidden off-screen — previously nothing indicated the toolbar scrolls horizontally

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- 🔗 **Share Scripts via Link**: New Share button in the script library creates a link (`?share=<id>`) that opens the script on any device. Backed by a Cloudflare Pages Function + KV (free tier); shares auto-expire after 30 days
- 📴 **Offline Support / Installable PWA**: New service worker caches the app shell and hashed assets — auto-scroll mode now works fully offline (ideal for iPhone/iPad where it is the only mode), and the app can be installed from the browser
- ⚙️ **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow runs tests and a production build on every push/PR

### Changed

- 🖼️ **Icons Inlined**: Toolbar icons are now inline SVG instead of being fetched from unpkg.com — zero external requests, instant rendering, works offline
- ⚡ **Rendering Performance**: Script lines are memoized; a speech-recognition result now re-renders only the affected lines instead of every word span (large scripts stay smooth)
- 💾 **Settings Persistence**: Debounced (400ms) — no more full-settings serialization on every keystroke
- 📊 **Analytics**: Replaced Google Analytics with cookieless Cloudflare Web Analytics; landing-page privacy text updated accordingly
- 🔒 **CSP Tightened**: Removed unpkg.com, googletagmanager.com, and google-analytics.com from the Content-Security-Policy

### Fixed

- 🐛 **Settings Not Saving**: `language` and `mirrorX` were missing from the persistence dependency list — changing only them was never saved
- 🌐 **Greek Alert in English UI**: "Speech recognition not supported" message is now in English and suggests auto-scroll mode
- 🧹 **Dead Code Removed**: Non-functional `renderMarkdown` state (including a call that could crash file import) and the obsolete Apache `.htaccess`
- 🏷️ **Version Mismatch**: package.json, README badge, and JSON-LD `softwareVersion` now report the real version

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- 🔧 **Public Assets Deployed**: Fixed `.gitignore` excluding `public/` directory — favicons, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, manifest, `_headers`, and OG image were never being deployed
- 🖼️ **Social Share Image**: Fixed `og:image` and `twitter:image` URLs pointing to non-existent GitHub raw path
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Added `<main>` landmark to landing page and app
- ♿ **Contrast**: Improved Edit button contrast in script library
- 🔒 **Security Headers**: Added `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, and `Content-Security-Policy` headers
- 🐛 **Broken HTML**: Fixed mismatched `<h2>...</p>` tag in landing page footer
- 🔁 **Redirect Loop**: Removed `_redirects` rewrite rule that conflicted with Cloudflare Pages' built-in pretty URLs
